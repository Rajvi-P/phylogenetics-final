Background:

Yersinia pestis is infamous for causing plague, such as the Bubonic plague and the Justinian plague, killing millions.

Antiqua strain is thought to be the ancestral branch of the plague pathogen (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1482938/).

Specifically, the pMT1 plasmid found in Yersinia Pestis is a virulence factor that promotes tissue invasion (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC108724/). 

Several whole genome sequnces of the pMT1 plasmid from the bacteria were gathered from GenBank and NCBI's RefSeq.

Sequences collected were comprised of various strains of pMT1. 

Searches of the strains on Joint Genome Institute produced scientific study citations that mentioned the origin of some strains.

Confirmed by accession number, using NCBI assembly to match RefSeq and Genbank numbers. Strains found to be having unknown origins or made in a lab or were removed.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Goal:
Understand evolutionary history of Yersinia pestis based on pMT plasmid evolution
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 1: Collect data

Completed - Data received from NCBI's GenBank and stored separately in the raw-data folder. Data chosen based on being around 100,000 nucleotides
long, which matches the average sequence of the pMT1 genome. Chose only complete sequences of pMT1.



Step 2: Quality control

Completed - data received in FASTA form so already completed by NCBI



Step 3: Alignment

Completed - using ClustalW

Description: ClustalW is a software used for multiple sequence alignment of nucleotides.

It is the most user friendly and performs quality alignments using progressive alignment methods.

Assumptions: all aligned sequences are evolutionarily related, rate of change in sequences is constant

Limitations: struggles to align distantly related sequences, takes very long to align big number of sequences

Code:     clustalw2 -ALIGN -INFILE=pestis-pMT1-all.fasta -OUTFILE=pestis-pMT1-all-clustalw.fasta -OUTPUT=FASTA


Completed-using Mafft

Description: Mafft is a multiple sequence alignment tool that progressively aligns large sequences quickly

and is macos friendly.

Assumptions: input sequences are homologous (from a common ancestor) (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3603318/),

all lineages have the same evolutionary rate (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4920119/)

Limitations: has no function to exclude divergent input sequences (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4920119/)

Code:     mafft pestis-pMT1-all.fasta > pestis-pMT1-all-mafft.fasta



Step 4: Distance-based tree and parsimony-based tree using the ape and phangorn R packages

Completed- Parsimony Tree per each Clustalw and Mafft Alignment with selecting NZ_LBFJ01000024.1 as root.

Description: The ape and phangorn R packages will create distance-based trees and parsimony-based trees.

Parsimony-based methods will create a tree that minimizes the amount of evolutionary change required to explain the data.

Assumptions:  Parsimony methods assume independence among characters. 

Limitations: Parsimony-based may not produce an accurate tree due to assuming the simplest explanation of evolutionary change is

correct; trees may be inconsistent.

Note: root all trees using root(tre.ini,outgroup=“name of clade plasmids”) or root(tre.ini, node=number)

Code:

library(ape)

library(adegenet)

library(phangorn)

dna <- fasta2DNAbin(file="/Users/rajvipatel/phylogenetics-final/data/pestis-pMT1-all-mafft.fasta")
or dna <- fasta2DNAbin(file="/Users/rajvipatel/phylogenetics-final/data/pestis-pMT1-all-clustalw.fasta")

dna2 <- as.phyDat(dna)

tre.ini <- nj(dist.dna(dna,model="raw"))

parsimony(tre.ini, dna2)

tre.pars <- optim.parsimony(tre.ini, dna2)

plot(tre.ini)

nodelabels()

root(tre.ini,outgroup="CP000309.1 Yersinia pestis Antiqua plasmid pMT, complete sequence")

plot(tre.pars, cex=0.6)
title("pMT alignment parsimony-based tree")


Completed- Distance Tree per each Clustalw and Mafft Alignment with selecting NZ_LBFJ01000024.1 as root.

Description: The ape and phangorn R packages will create distance-based trees and parsimony-based trees.

Distance-based methods will create a tree by calculating pairwise distances between molecular sequences. 

Assumptions:  Distance methods assume rate of molecular evolution is constant over time and across lineages.

Limitations: Distance-based relies on an existing model and which model is chosen; there is no flexibility.

Note: root all trees using root(tre.ini,outgroup=“name of clade plasmids”) or root(tre.ini, node=number)

Code:

library(ape)

library(adegenet)

library(phangorn)

dna <- fasta2DNAbin(file="/Users/rajvipatel/phylogenetics-final/data/pestis-pMT1-all-mafft.fasta")
or dna <- fasta2DNAbin(file="/Users/rajvipatel/phylogenetics-final/data/pestis-pMT1-all-clustalw.fasta")

D <- dist.dna(dna, model="TN93")

tre <- nj(D)

plot(tre.ini)

nodelabels()

root(tre.ini,outgroup="CP000309.1 Yersinia pestis Antiqua plasmid pMT, complete sequence")

tre <- ladderize(tre)

plot(tre, cex=.6)
title("pMT alignment distance-based tree")
